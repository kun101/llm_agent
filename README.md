## API Keys Required

### AI Pipe Token
- The application uses AI Pipe's OpenRouter proxy by default
- Get your token from [AI Pipe](https://aipipe.org)
- Provides access to multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Google Custom Search Engine
- **API Key**: Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
- **CX ID**: Create a custom search engine at [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)

### AI Pipe (Optional)
- Get your API key from [AI Pipe](https://aipipe.org/keys)
- Used for executing serverless AI workflows

## Usage

1. Enter your API credentials in the sidebar
2. Type a question or task in the main input field
3. The agent will automatically:
   - Determine which tools are needed
   - Call the appropriate tools
   - Gather information
   - Provide a comprehensive answer

## Example Queries

- "What is the latest news about OpenAI?" (uses Google Search)
- "Calculate the compound interest for $1000 at 5% annual rate for 10 years" (uses JavaScript)
- "Analyze the sentiment of 'I love this product'" (uses AI Pipe)

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap 5
- **Architecture**: Tool-calling loop with OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Tools**: Modular tool system with easy extensibility
- **Security**: Sandboxed JavaScript execution environment

## Files

- `index.html`: Main application interface
- `script.js`: Core application logic and tool implementations
- `config.js`: Configuration and tool definitions

## Customization

You can easily add new tools by:
1. Adding a tool definition to the `tools` array in `script.js`
2. Implementing the corresponding handler function
3. Adding a demo configuration in `config.js`

The agent will automatically discover and use new tools in its reasoning loop.
